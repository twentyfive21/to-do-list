## Features
- Add Tasks: You can add new tasks to your to-do list by simply typing the task description and pressing the "Submit" button. The task will be dynamically added to the list.
- Edit Tasks: If you need to modify a task, just click on the task description and edit it directly in the list. Once you're done editing, press Enter or click outside the task to save the changes.
- Delete Tasks: To remove a task from your list, click on the "Delete" button next to the respective task. The task will be instantly removed from the list.
- Local Storage: Your to-do list will be automatically saved to the local storage of your browser. This means that even if you close the application or refresh the page, your tasks will still be available when you return.

## Learning Outcome 
### During the development of this To-Do List Application, I gained practical experience in utilizing local storage and manipulating the DOM. This enabled me to implement persistent task storage and dynamically update the task list. I learned a lot and am excited to finally be able to store data to make the website more interactive for the user. I loved this project a lot and had a lot of fun. While local storage is new to me and was a little challenging, I definitely will continue working with it! The more you practice the better keep coding!
